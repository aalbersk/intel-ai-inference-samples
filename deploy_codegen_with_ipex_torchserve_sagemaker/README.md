# Deploy optimized Codegen model with Intel® Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) and Torchserve on AWS Sagemaker

## Description
This sample provide code to deploy Codegen 2.5 model with Intel® Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) with Torchserve on AWS Sagemaker on instances supporting 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors. The notebook provided builds a Docker container, pushes it to AWS ECR, creates a torchserve file and puts in on AWS S3 bucket and creates and invokes an AWS Sagemaker endpoint.
